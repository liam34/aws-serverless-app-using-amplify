   need your IAM USER credentials, changes will reflect in dynamoDB table.
4. under lambda edit designer tab in function code.
5. open your IDE (i use visual code, have realy good plugins and easy to use) to build your code function and replace function codes in aws lambda console.
6. install lambda extension in vs code extension find --> AWS lambda boilerplate
7. continue to code all the function needed.
